This was the final group project for the course Digital Game Designs in Columbia University.

The game is complete and playable! Here is [a link to the finished game](https://play.unity.com/en/games/4630cfe9-253e-44cb-a23e-fdab3132505b/webgl-builds).

It is a top-down multilevel game with one goal - help Little Raccoon get home! ü¶ù

Within my group, I was responsible for:
- coding `Player.cs` and `CameraFollow.cs` (as well as helping with any bugs and issues in the other scripts)
- designing the characters, environments, and objects
- implementing the sound effects
- implementing the UI of the game's main menu and instruction menu
